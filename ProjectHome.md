This was originally written to automatically log myself on to a wifi network through a web gateway when associating to the appropriate SSID.  It currently only uses an HTTP(S) POST but the response action can be altered (in c/obj-c).  Easily configurable options are SSID, login URL, and POST data (which is secured in Keychain).
